# DataAnalysis

## Project Component

There are two tools in this project, one is for data analysing another is for data processing and correlation detection.
The data analysing tool is in folder Graphs, and the processing tool is in the default column.

## How to use these tools

### Before running

This analysis too is only for the game Fox_Frenzy, the data is stored in the StreamingAssets folder in that project, please import the JSON file into
the default folder to start your own data processing, and the data analysing tool requires .txt file,
which stores in the default Assets folder in the game. The data given here are the demo data that generated by the developer.

### Data Processing Tool

There are three files in this section, they are separately: DataAbstract, GAN and Clustering. The order to execuate these three files is important, the step should be
First, run DataAbstract class, Second, run GAN, Finally, run Clustering.

### Data Analysis Tool

Run the DataVisible class to generate two graphs that illustrate the player performance.
